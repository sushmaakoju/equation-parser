# A polynomial equation parser for polynomial equations
Implementation of polynomial equation parser algorithms in Python.
This is a **proof-of-concept** using SymPy, NumPy and a string Parsing algorithm to assign symbols and create equations that can be evaluated by applying data from csv, excel files data-sources.

Work-in-progress: add matrices, use Tensorflow inputs and parse more complex equations in string format, using context-free grammar and abstract syntax tree.
